# HeqSim (Heterogeneous Quantum Computing Simulator)

## About
 This Python library allows you to perform the simulation of distributed quantum computing with 
 - Different number of qubits on each quantum processor
 - Different execution time on each quantum processor
 - Arbitrary network topology
 - Reduction of the total execution time

The following features are going to be added for future release
- Physical noise on each quantum processor (short-term goal)
- Fault-tolerant quantum computing (long-term goal)

## Installation
You need to execute the command below to install this library
```
pip install heqsim
````

## Documentation

## Contribution
I welcome your contribution, such as feature requests, bug report and of course, your pull requests!!

Do not forget to add your test code if you develop a new feature :)
