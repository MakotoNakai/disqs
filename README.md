# HeqSim: Heterogeneous Quantum (Computing) Simulator

## About
 This Python library allows you to perform the simulation of heterogeneous quantum computing 
 in terms of 

 - Different execution time on each physical quantum processor
 - Arbitrary network topology
 - reduction of the total execution time

Currently, the following features are under development
- Physical noise on each physical quantum processor (short-term goal)
- Fault-tolerant quantum computing (long-term goal)

## Installation
You need to execute the command below to install this library
`pip install heqsim`

## Documentation
Please refer to this link if you would like to know more details about this simulator

## Contribution
I welcome your contribution, such as feature requests, bug report and of course, your pull requests!!
Do not forget to implement your test code if you develop a new feature :)
